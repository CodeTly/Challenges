Hey Coder! Ready for a fun challenge? ðŸŒŸ

Imagine you have a list of numbers. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find two numbers in that list that add up to a specific target number. But hereâ€™s the catch: you canâ€™t use the same number twice! Once youâ€™ve found them, just return the indices of those two numbers.

Example Adventures:

1. Input: `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]`, `target = 9`  
   Output: `[0, 1]`  
   Explanation: Since `nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9`, we return `[0, 1]`.

2. Input: `nums = [3, 2, 4]`, `target = 6`  
   Output: `[1, 2]`  
  Explanation:  `nums[1] + nums[2] = 2 + 4 = 6`, so the result is `[1, 2]`.

3. Input: `nums = [3, 3]`, `target = 6`  
   Output: `[0, 1]`  
   Explanation: `nums[0] + nums[1] = 3 + 3 = 6`, so the answer is `[0, 1]`.

ðŸŽ¯ Your Goal: Write a function that takes in the list of numbers and the target value, then returns the indices of the two numbers that hit the target.
