Hey Coders! 👋

Let's dive into an interesting challenge! 🎯 

### Problem:
Given an integer n, your task is to find the *smallest prime palindrome* greater than or equal to n. But before we get started, here are a couple of key points to keep in mind:

- Prime Numbers: An integer is prime if it has exactly two divisors: 1 and itself. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13 are prime numbers. Remember, 1 is not a prime number!

- Palindromes: An integer is a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards. For example, 101 and 12321 are palindromes.

### Examples:
1. If n = 6, the output is 7.
2. If n = 8, the output is 11.
3. If n = 13, the output is 101.

Your mission is to code a solution that finds this special number efficiently! 🧑‍💻✨

And your time-limit is 3 days! Happy Coding!

Good luck! 💪
